FaceDetection project is an ERASMUS project who use DeepLearning (Python + Tensorflow) 
to predict if an image is photoshopped or not. For the development we are using Python 3.12.2, but
it's supposed to work with Python 3.6 and above even if we haven't tested it though.
Still important to have a Python 3.6 and above to run this project so you can download
Tensorflow 2.0.0 and above with Keras integrated.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Cloning the Project

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example:

   ```
   cd /path/to/your/directory
   ```

2. Clone the AI project from GitHub, follow these steps:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/A-DONALD/FaceDetectionProject.git
   ```

## Launch the project

1. After the repository has been cloned, navigate to the project folder:

   ```
   cd FaceDetectionProject
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Execute the `run.py` script with the commands:

   ```
   python run.py
   ```
